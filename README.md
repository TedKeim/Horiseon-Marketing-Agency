# Horiseon Marketing Agency - Code refactoring

Horiseon is a marketing agency that needs their codebase to follow accessibility standards so that their website is optimized for search engines.

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards WHEN I view the source code THEN I find semantic HTML elements WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning WHEN I view the image elements THEN I find accessible alt attributes WHEN I view the heading attributes THEN they fall in sequential order WHEN I view the title element THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

The Horiseon marketing agency website looks like this:
